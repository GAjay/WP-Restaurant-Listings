## Description ##

WP Restaurant Listings is a **lightweight** restaurant listing plugin for adding restaurant listing functionality to your WordPress site. Being shortcode based, it can work with any theme (given a bit of CSS styling) and is really simple to setup.

### Features ###

* Add, manage, and categorize restaurant listings using the familiar WordPress UI.
* Searchable & filterable ajax powered restaurant listings added to your pages via shortcodes.
* Frontend forms for guests and registered users to submit & manage restaurant listings.
* Allow restaurant listers to preview their listing before it goes live. The preview matches the appearance of a live restaurant listing.
* Developer friendly code â€” Custom Post Types & template files.

The plugin comes with several shortcodes to output restaurants in various formats, and since it's built with Custom Post Types you are free to extend it further through themes.
